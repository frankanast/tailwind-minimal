# Minimal TailwindUI

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This comes with the following already installed, configured and ready to use: 
* Tailwind CSS
* Postcss and autoprefixer
* Tailwind UI (all dependencies configured, Inter set as default font)
* Heroicons

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
